# 🚢 Maritime Intelligence Widget - Implementation Complete

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Implementation Time:** ~1 hour

---

## Overview

The Maritime Intelligence Widget provides **AI-powered maritime impact analysis** for earthquake and tsunami events using Perplexity AI. When a significant earthquake occurs (M6.0+) or a tsunami warning is issued, the widget automatically analyzes the maritime implications and displays actionable intelligence.

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test Page (Recommended)

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the test page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test/maritime
   ```

3. **Select a scenario:**
   - San Francisco M7.2 + Tsunami
   - Los Angeles M6.8
   - Seattle M7.5 + Tsunami
   - Tokyo Bay M7.0 + Tsunami
   - Vancouver M6.5

4. **Observe the AI analysis:**
   - Port status intelligence
   - Vessel guidance
   - Emergency contacts
   - Historical context

### Option 2: Main Dashboard

1. **Trigger a significant earthquake alert:**
   - Use manual earthquake sweep
   - Wait for real M6.0+ earthquake
   - Simulate test earthquake

2. **Widget appears automatically:**
   - Shows below tsunami warning banner
   - Above the event map
   - Auto-fetches maritime intelligence

### Option 3: API Direct Test

```bash
# Test the API endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/maritime/intelligence \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "magnitude": 7.2,
    "location": "San Francisco Bay Area",
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "tsunamiWarning": true
  }'
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
```bash
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxx  # Already set ✅
```

**Optional (already configured from tsunami hardening):**
```bash
EXTERNAL_REQUEST_USER_AGENT=WeatherAlert/1.0 (+https://yourdomain.com)
```

### API Costs

**Perplexity Pricing:**
- Model: Sonar Large (128k context)
- ~$0.01-0.02 per earthquake analysis
- Your $20 credit = ~1000-2000 analyses
- Expected monthly cost: $0.20-0.40 (20 earthquakes)

## What the Widget Provides

### 1. Port Status Intelligence

**Example Output:**
```
🏢 Port Status

San Francisco Port
🔴 CLOSED - Tsunami warning
Estimated reopening: 8-12 hours after all-clear

Oakland Port  
🟢 OPEN - Accepting diversions
Contact: +1-510-627-1100

Los Angeles Port
🟡 MONITORING - Standing by
```

### 2. Vessel Guidance

**Example Output:**
```
🚢 Vessel Guidance

Vessels in port:
Double mooring lines, secure cargo, await harbor master instructions

Vessels approaching port (within 50nm):
Do NOT enter port. Maintain position in deep water (>200m depth) or divert to alternative port

Vessels in deep ocean (>1000m):
Safe to ride out tsunami. Wave height <1m in deep water. Maintain course, avoid coastal areas for 6 hours
```

### 3. Emergency Contacts

**Example Output:**
```
📞 Emergency Contacts

US Coast Guard - San Francisco
+1-415-399-3547
VHF Channel 16

San Francisco Port Authority
+1-415-274-0400

Maritime Emergency Coordination
VHF Channel 16 (156.8 MHz)
```

### 4. Historical Context

**Example Output:**
```
🕒 Historical Context

Similar M7.1 earthquake in 2011 resulted in:
- San Francisco port closed for 14 hours
- Oakland port remained operational
- No vessel damage reported
- Estimated economic impact: $2.5M in delays

Based on historical data, expect 8-12 hour port closure for this event.
```

## Sample AI Query

When M7.2 earthquake occurs near San Francisco, the widget sends:

```
URGENT MARITIME EMERGENCY ANALYSIS

Event: Magnitude 7.2 earthquake 
Location: San Francisco Bay Area (37.7749°, -122.4194°)
Time: 5 minutes ago
TSUNAMI WARNING ACTIVE

Provide IMMEDIATE maritime intelligence:

1. PORT STATUS (within 500km):
   - Which major ports affected?
   - Are ports closed or under tsunami warning?
   - Estimated reopening times?
   - Port authority contacts

2. VESSEL SAFETY GUIDANCE:
   - Vessels in affected ports
   - Vessels approaching ports (within 50nm)
   - Vessels in coastal waters (<200m depth)
   - Vessels in deep ocean (>1000m depth)

3. TSUNAMI BEHAVIOR:
   - Wave heights in harbor vs open ocean
   - Safe depths for riding out tsunami
   - Coastal areas to avoid
   - Wave arrival timeline

4. SHIPPING ROUTES:
   - Major lanes affected
   - Recommended detours
   - Expected delays

5. EMERGENCY CONTACTS:
   - Coast Guard (phone + VHF)
   - Port authorities
   - Maritime coordination centers

6. HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
   - Similar events (last 20 years)
   - Port closure durations
   - Lessons learned

FORMAT WITH HEADERS. Include specific contacts and VHF channels.
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Enhancements (If Needed)

1. **Fleet Registry** - Manual vessel tracking
2. **Port Database** - Pre-populated major ports
3. **Alert Templates** - Maritime-specific messaging
4. **Historical Data** - Build internal knowledge base
5. **Real-time Tracking** - If you get MarineTraffic API access later

### Low-Priority Additions

- [ ] Save maritime analyses to database
- [ ] Generate PDF reports
- [ ] Email maritime intelligence to contacts
- [ ] Export to CSV for fleet managers
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Not Showing
**Check:**
1. Is there a M6.0+ earthquake in recent alerts?
2. Is `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` set in `.env.local`?
3. Check browser console for errors

### API Errors
**Common Issues:**
1. **Invalid API key** - Verify Perplexity key
2. **Rate limiting** - Perplexity has generous limits
3. **Network timeout** - Check internet connection

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check API directly
curl http://localhost:3000/api/maritime/intelligence?magnitude=7.0&location=Test&latitude=37&longitude=-122
```

### Slow Response
**Normal behavior:**
- First query: 8-12 seconds (AI search + analysis)
- Response includes 5-15 online sources
- Structured parsing takes 2-3 seconds

**If consistently slow (>30 seconds):**
- Check Perplexity API status
- Verify network connection
- Consider caching (future enhancement)

- Review AI output quality periodically

### Updates
- Perplexity model upgrades automatically applied
- No schema changes needed
