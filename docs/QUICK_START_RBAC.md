# Quick Start: Testing RBAC & Data Source Traceability

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Database Changes

```bash
# If using Railway
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or locally
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Step 2: Create Test Users

```bash
# Create 4 test users with different roles
railway run npx tsx scripts/seed-test-users.ts

# Or locally
npx tsx scripts/seed-test-users.ts
```

You'll see output like:
```
‚úÖ Created SUPER_ADMIN: Super Admin User
   Email: superadmin@test.com
   Phone: +1234567890

‚úÖ Created ORG_ADMIN: Organization Admin
   Email: orgadmin@test.com
   Phone: +1234567891

‚úÖ Created OPERATOR: Operator User
   Email: operator@test.com
   Phone: +1234567892

‚úÖ Created VIEWER: Viewer User
   Email: viewer@test.com
   Phone: +1234567893
```

### üîë **Important: Development OTP**

For **all test phone numbers** (+1234567890 through +1234567893), use:

**OTP Code: `123456`**

This works **only in development mode** (`NODE_ENV=development`) and **only for test phone numbers**. Real phone numbers will receive actual SMS OTPs.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:** This bypass is automatically disabled in production!

## üß™ Testing RBAC

### Test 1: VIEWER Role (Read-Only)

1. **Login**: Go to `/login`, enter `+1234567893`
2. **Enter OTP**: Use `123456` (works for all test users in development)
3. **Try to view**: ‚úÖ Can see contacts and groups
4. **Try to create**: ‚ùå "Create Group" button should be hidden/disabled
5. **Try API**: ‚ùå POST requests will return 403 Forbidden

**üîë Development OTP:** All test phone numbers (+1234567890-93) accept `123456` as the OTP in development mode.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Can navigate and view all pages
- Cannot see action buttons (Create, Edit, Delete)
- API calls for write operations fail with permission error

### Test 2: OPERATOR Role

1. **Login**: Go to `/login`, enter `+1234567892`
2. **Enter OTP**: Use `123456`
3. **Try to view**: ‚úÖ Can see contacts and groups
4. **Try to create group**: ‚úÖ Should work!
5. **Try to delete contact**: ‚ùå Should fail (no permission)
6. **Try to view audit logs**: ‚ùå Should be hidden/forbidden

**Expected Behavior:**
- Can create and edit contacts
- Can manage contact groups
- Can send alerts
- Cannot delete contacts
- Cannot access audit logs or user management

### Test 3: ORG_ADMIN Role

1. **Login**: Go to `/login`, enter `+1234567891`
2. **Enter OTP**: Use `123456`
3. **Try everything OPERATOR can**: ‚úÖ All should work
4. **Try to delete contact**: ‚úÖ Should work!
5. **Try to view audit logs**: ‚úÖ Should work!
6. **Try to manage users**: ‚ùå Should fail (SUPER_ADMIN only)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Can do everything OPERATOR can
- Can delete contacts
- Can view audit logs
- Can manage organization settings
- Cannot manage users or data sources

### Test 4: SUPER_ADMIN Role

1. **Login**: Go to `/login`, enter `+1234567890`
2. **Enter OTP**: Use `123456`
3. **Try everything**: ‚úÖ Everything should work!

**Expected Behavior:**
- Full access to all features
- Can manage users
- Can configure data sources
- Can access all settings

## üìä Testing Data Source Traceability

### Viewing Alert Sources

1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Earthquake Monitoring**
2. Click on any alert
3. Look for "Data Sources" section
4. Should show badges like: `USGS` `EMSC` `JMA`

### Example Alert with Sources

```json
{
  "id": "alert_123",
  "magnitude": 6.5,
  "location": "Off the coast of Japan",
  "dataSources": ["USGS", "JMA", "EMSC"],
  "primarySource": "USGS",
  "sourceMetadata": {
    "usgs": {
      "eventId": "us7000abcd",
      "significance": 850
    },
    "jma": {
      "eventId": "jma2025abcd",
      "intensity": 5
    }
  }
}
```

## üîç Verifying RBAC is Working

### Check 1: API Response

Try calling a protected endpoint:

```bash
# As VIEWER (should fail)
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/contact-groups \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Group"}'

# Expected response:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Insufficient permissions",
  "required": "MANAGE_GROUPS",
  "userRole": "VIEWER"
}
```

### Check 2: Audit Logs

```sql
-- View recent permission denials
SELECT 
  u.name,
  u.role,
  a.action,
  a.resource,
  a."createdAt"
FROM audit_logs a
JOIN users u ON a."userId" = u.id
WHERE a.action = 'PERMISSION_DENIED'
ORDER BY a."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check 3: UI Elements

**VIEWER should NOT see:**
- "Create" buttons
- "Edit" buttons
- "Delete" buttons
- Settings pages
- User management

**OPERATOR should see:**
- "Create Contact" button ‚úÖ
- "Create Group" button ‚úÖ
- "Send Alert" button ‚úÖ
- But NOT "Delete Contact" ‚ùå

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No groups yet" even though Contact Groups page exists

**Solution:** The user needs `VIEW_GROUPS` permission. Check user role:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@test.com';
```

If role is `VIEWER`, they should be able to view but not create groups.

### Issue: Cannot create test users

**Error:** `User already exists`

**Solution:** Test users already created. To reset:

```sql
-- Delete existing test users
DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@test.com';

-- Then run seed script again
npx tsx scripts/seed-test-users.ts
```

### Issue: Permission denied but user should have access

**Check:**
1. User's role in database
2. Session is valid
3. User is active (`isActive = true`)

```sql
SELECT id, name, role, "isActive" FROM users WHERE id = 'user-id';
```

## üì± Test User Credentials

| Role | Phone | Email | Can Do |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| **SUPER_ADMIN** | +1234567890 | superadmin@test.com | Everything |

## üÜò Need Help?

1. Check audit logs for permission denials
2. Verify user role in database
