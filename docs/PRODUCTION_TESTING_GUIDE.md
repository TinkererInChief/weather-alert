**Environment:** Railway Production (Test Environment)

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue: Unable to Access Some Pages

### Likely Causes:
1. **Not logged in** - Most pages require authentication
2. **Wrong role** - Some pages require admin permissions
3. **User not approved** - New registrations need approval
4. **Session expired** - Need to re-login

---

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Access & Authentication

#### Step 1.1: Check if You Have a User Account
```bash
# Option A: Check database directly
# Connect to Railway database and run:
SELECT id, email, phone, role, "approvalStatus", "isActive" 
FROM users 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

# Option B: Use Railway CLI
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT email, role, \"approvalStatus\", \"isActive\" FROM users;"
```

**Expected Results:**
- If you see your account: Note the `role` and `approvalStatus`
- If no accounts exist: You need to create one

---

#### Step 1.2: Create Your First Admin User (If Needed)

**Option A: Direct Database Insert (Recommended for first user)**
```sql
-- Connect to Railway database
INSERT INTO users (
  id, 
  email, 
  phone, 
  name, 
  role, 
  "isActive", 
  "approvalStatus",
  "createdAt",
  "updatedAt"
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid()::text,
  'your-email@example.com',
  '+1234567890',
  'Admin User',
  'SUPER_ADMIN',
  true,
  'approved',
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

**Option B: Use Registration Flow (For subsequent users)**
1. Go to: `https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/register`
2. Fill in the form
3. Submit registration
4. Have an admin approve you (or approve yourself via database)

---

#### Step 1.3: Login to the System

1. **Navigate to Login Page:**
   ```
   https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/login
   ```

2. **Enter your phone number** (the one in the database)

3. **Request OTP** - You should receive an SMS

4. **Enter OTP code**

5. **Verify you're logged in** - Should redirect to `/dashboard`

**Troubleshooting Login:**
- **No SMS received?** Check Twilio credentials in `.env.local`
- **Invalid OTP?** Check if OTP is being generated (check `sms_otps` table)
- **Redirects to login?** Session might not be created properly

---

### Phase 2: Test Each Page Systematically

#### 2.1: Public Pages (No Auth Required)

| Page | URL | Expected Result | Test |
|------|-----|-----------------|------|
| Homepage | `/` | Landing page loads | âœ… Should work |
| Login | `/login` | Login form displays | âœ… Should work |
| Register | `/register` | Registration form displays | âœ… Should work |
| About | `/about` | About page loads | âœ… Should work |
| Help | `/help` | Help documentation | âœ… Should work |
| Privacy | `/privacy` | Privacy policy | âœ… Should work |
| Terms | `/terms` | Terms of service | âœ… Should work |
| Data Sources | `/data-sources` | Data sources info | âœ… Should work |

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Test public pages
curl -I https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/
curl -I https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/register
curl -I https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/login
```

---

#### 2.2: Protected Dashboard Pages (Auth Required)

**Prerequisites:** Must be logged in

| Page | URL | Required Role | Expected Result |
|------|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | Any authenticated | Main dashboard |
| Earthquake Monitoring | `/dashboard/alerts` | Any authenticated | Earthquake map & alerts |
| Tsunami Monitoring | `/dashboard/tsunami` | Any authenticated | Tsunami monitoring |
| Contacts | `/dashboard/contacts` | Any authenticated | Contact list & CRUD |
| Contact Groups | `/dashboard/groups` | Any authenticated | Group management |
| Alert History | `/dashboard/alerts/history` | Any authenticated | Past alerts |
| Notifications | `/dashboard/notifications` | Any authenticated | Notification logs |
| Audit Trail | `/dashboard/audit` | Any authenticated | System audit logs |
| System Status | `/dashboard/status` | Any authenticated | Health checks |

**How to Test:**
1. Login first
2. Navigate to each URL
3. Verify page loads without redirect to `/login`

**If you get redirected to login:**
- Session expired - login again
- Cookie not being set - check browser settings
- Auth middleware issue - check server logs

---

#### 2.3: Admin-Only Pages (Requires Admin Role)

| Page | URL | Required Role | Expected Result |
|------|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| User Management | `/dashboard/users` | SUPER_ADMIN or ORG_ADMIN | User approval dashboard |
| Settings | `/dashboard/settings` | SUPER_ADMIN or ORG_ADMIN | System settings |

**How to Test:**
1. Login as admin user (SUPER_ADMIN or ORG_ADMIN)
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/users`
3. Should see user management interface

**If you see "Access Denied":**
- Your user role is not admin
- Update your role in database:
  ```sql
  UPDATE users 
  SET role = 'SUPER_ADMIN' 
  WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
  ```

---

### Phase 3: Test New Features

#### 3.1: User Registration Flow

**Test Steps:**
1. Open incognito/private window
2. Go to `/register`
3. Fill form with test data:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Phone: +1234567891
4. Submit form
5. Verify success message
6. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```
7. Verify `approvalStatus = 'pending'` and `isActive = false`

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… User created with pending status
- âœ… Cannot login until approved
- âœ… Audit log entry created

---

#### 3.2: User Approval Flow

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/dashboard/users`
3. Should see test user in "Pending" tab
4. Click "Approve" button
5. Verify user status changes to "Approved"
6. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT "approvalStatus", "isActive", "approvedBy", "approvedAt" 
   FROM users 
   WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Status changes to 'approved'
- âœ… `isActive` set to `true`
- âœ… `approvedBy` and `approvedAt` populated
- âœ… Audit log entry created

---

#### 3.3: Delivery Status Widget

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as any user
2. Go to `/dashboard`
3. Scroll down to "Delivery Status" widget
4. Verify it loads (may show 0 if no messages sent yet)
5. Try switching time ranges (24h, 7d, 30d)

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Widget displays without errors
- âœ… Shows statistics (even if 0)
- âœ… Time range selector works
- âœ… Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

**If widget shows errors:**
- Check `/api/delivery/stats` endpoint
- Verify `delivery_logs` table exists
- Check browser console for errors

---

### Phase 4: API Endpoint Testing

#### 4.1: Test API Endpoints with curl

**Registration API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "API Test User",
    "email": "apitest@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567892"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful. Your account is pending approval.",
  "userId": "..."
}
```

---

**Users List API (requires auth):**
```bash
# First, get your session cookie from browser
# Then:
curl https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/api/users \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "users": [...]
}
```

---

**Delivery Stats API (requires auth):**
```bash
curl https://appealing-playfulness-production.up.railway.app/api/delivery/stats?range=24h \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stats": {
    "total": 0,
    "sent": 0,
    "delivered": 0,
    "read": 0,
    "failed": 0,
    "queued": 0,
    "byChannel": {...}
  }
}
```
