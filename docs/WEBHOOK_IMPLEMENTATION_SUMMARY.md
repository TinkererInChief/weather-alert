# 📡 Webhook Implementation Summary

**Date:** Oct 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Configuration  

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Built complete webhook infrastructure to track message acknowledgments in real-time.

### **3 Webhook Endpoints Created:**

1. **`/api/webhooks/twilio`** - SMS delivery & read receipts
2. **`/api/webhooks/sendgrid`** - Email opens & clicks  
3. **`/api/webhooks/whatsapp`** - WhatsApp read receipts

## 🔧 Code Changes

### 1. SMS Service (`lib/services/alert-routing-service.ts`)

**Added status callback URL:**
```typescript
const result = await twilio.messages.create({
  body: smsBody,
  from: twilioPhone,
  to: phone,
  statusCallback: `${baseUrlForWebhook}/api/webhooks/twilio` // ← NEW
})
```

**What it does:** Twilio will POST delivery status updates to this endpoint.

---

### 2. Email Services

**Updated both files:**
- `lib/services/email-service.ts`
- `lib/services/alert-routing-service.ts`

**Added tracking settings:**
```typescript
trackingSettings: {
  clickTracking: { enable: true },  // ← NEW
  openTracking: { enable: true }    // ← NEW
}
```

**What it does:** SendGrid will track email opens and clicks, then POST events to webhook.

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### **Signature Verification**

All webhooks verify authenticity:

**Twilio:**
```typescript
- Uses X-Twilio-Signature header
- HMAC SHA1 verification with TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
- Prevents unauthorized webhook calls
```

**SendGrid:**
```typescript
- Uses X-Twilio-Email-Event-Webhook-Signature
- HMAC SHA256 verification with SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_KEY
- Optional but recommended
```

**WhatsApp:**
```typescript
- Uses same Twilio signature verification
- Same security as SMS webhooks
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Message Lifecycle with Webhooks:**

```
1. App sends message
   ↓
2. Provider accepts (returns message ID: msg_abc123)
   ↓
3. App stores delivery log:
   - providerMessageId: msg_abc123
   - status: queued
   - readAt: null
   ↓
4. Provider delivers message
   ↓
5. Provider POSTs webhook: "delivered" for msg_abc123
   ↓
6. Webhook handler finds log by providerMessageId
   ↓
7. Updates: deliveredAt = now, status = delivered
   ↓
8. Recipient opens message
   ↓
9. Provider POSTs webhook: "read/open" for msg_abc123
   ↓
10. Webhook handler updates: readAt = now ✅
   ↓
11. UI shows green checkmark: "Acknowledged" with timestamp
```

## 🎨 UI Updates

### **Before:**
```
| TIMESTAMP | CONTACT | CHANNEL | STATUS | PROVIDER | DELIVERED |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Oct 30... | MP      | Email   | sent   | SendGrid | Oct 30... |
```

### **After:**
```
| TIMESTAMP | CONTACT | CHANNEL | STATUS | PROVIDER | DELIVERED | ACKNOWLEDGED |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Oct 30... | MP      | Email   | sent   | SendGrid | Oct 30... | ✓ Oct 30...  |
| Oct 30... | MP      | SMS     | sent   | Twilio   | Oct 30... | -            |
```

## 🚀 Configuration Steps

### **Quick Start:**

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Required for signature verification
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_KEY=your_key  # Optional but recommended
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
   ```

2. **Configure Twilio Webhook**
   - Go to: https://console.twilio.com/
   - Set callback URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/twilio`
   - Enable events: sent, delivered, failed

3. **Configure SendGrid Webhook**
   - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/
   - Settings → Mail Settings → Event Webhook
   - Set URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/sendgrid`
   - Enable events: processed, delivered, open, click, bounce

4. **Test with ngrok (Local Development)**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   # Use ngrok URL in webhook configurations
   ```

5. **Verify**
   - Send test message
   - Check logs for webhook receipt
   - Verify database `read_at` column updates

---

## 📈 Database Changes

**No schema changes needed!** The `readAt` field already exists:

```prisma
model DeliveryLog {
  // ... other fields
  sentAt      DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)
  deliveredAt DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)
  readAt      DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)  // ← Already exists
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Local Testing:**
- [ ] Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
- [ ] Start ngrok tunnel: `ngrok http 3000`
- [ ] Configure webhooks with ngrok URL
- [ ] Send test SMS → Check logs for "delivered"
- [ ] Send test email → Open it → Check logs for "open"
- [ ] Verify `read_at` populated in database
- [ ] Verify UI shows green checkmark

### **Production Testing:**
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Configure webhooks with production URL
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Send test messages
- [ ] Monitor webhook logs
- [ ] Verify acknowledgment tracking

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### **View Webhook Logs:**
```bash
# Check if webhooks are being received
grep "Webhook" logs/*.log

# Filter by provider
grep "Twilio Webhook" logs/*.log
grep "SendGrid Webhook" logs/*.log
grep "WhatsApp Webhook" logs/*.log
```

### **Test Webhook Endpoints:**
```bash
# Health checks
curl https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/twilio
curl https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/sendgrid
curl https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/whatsapp
```

### **Query Database:**
```sql
-- Check acknowledgment rates
SELECT 
  channel,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(read_at) as acknowledged,
  ROUND(COUNT(read_at) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as ack_rate
FROM delivery_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY channel;

-- Recent acknowledgments
SELECT 
  channel,
  contact_id,
  delivered_at,
  read_at,
  read_at - delivered_at as time_to_acknowledge
FROM delivery_logs
WHERE read_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY read_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Email Open Tracking Limitations:**

1. **Image Loading Required**
   - Email clients must load images
   - Privacy-focused clients may block tracking pixels
   - Plain text emails cannot be tracked

2. **Not 100% Accurate**
   - Some opens may not be tracked
   - Some clients may block tracking
   - Consider clicks more reliable than opens

### **WhatsApp Read Receipts:**

1. **Business API Only**
   - Regular WhatsApp API doesn't support read receipts
   - Must use WhatsApp Business API
   - Requires approved templates

2. **User Settings**
   - Recipients must have read receipts enabled
   - Disabled by default in some regions

### **SMS Read Receipts:**

- **Not Available** for standard SMS
- Only available via WhatsApp or RCS
- SMS delivery confirmations only
