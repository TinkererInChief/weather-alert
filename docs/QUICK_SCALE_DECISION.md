# Quick Decision Guide: Scaling Vessel Tracking

## TL;DR

**Current:** 1,400 vessels on Railway ($5/mo)  
**Target:** 50,000-100,000 vessels  
**Verdict:** 🚨 Must migrate infrastructure. Railway won't work.

## Critical Numbers at 50K Vessels

| Metric | Value | Railway Limit | Status |
|--------|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Data ingestion** | 2 TB/month | 100 GB | ❌ 20x over |
| **Storage needed** | 140 GB | 100 GB | ❌ 1.4x over |
| **RAM needed** | 8 GB | 512 MB - 8 GB | ❌ Insufficient |
| **Position writes** | 300K/minute | N/A | ❌ Too high |

---

## What Will It Cost?

### Option 1: Stay on Railway (NOT POSSIBLE)
- **Max scale:** ~3,000 vessels
- **Cost:** Would be $300+/month with overages
- **Verdict:** ❌ Not viable

### Option 2: Migrate to TimescaleDB Cloud + Railway Web
- **Max scale:** 50,000 vessels easily
- **Cost:** **$370/month**
- **Complexity:** Low (managed)
- **Verdict:** ✅ Recommended for 50K vessels

### Option 3: Self-Host on AWS
- **Max scale:** 100,000+ vessels
- **Cost:** **$600-840/month**
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Verdict:** ✅ Best for 100K vessels

## What Is TimescaleDB?

**Short answer:** PostgreSQL optimized for time-series data

**Key benefits:**
- ✅ 75% storage savings with compression
- ✅ Automatic data retention (no cron jobs)
- ✅ Automatic downsampling (no scripts)
- ✅ 10-100x faster time-series queries
- ✅ Same PostgreSQL skills you already have

**Example:**
```sql
-- Regular PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE vessel_positions (...);

-- TimescaleDB (just one line added)
SELECT create_hypertable('vessel_positions', 'timestamp');

-- Now you get:
-- ✅ Automatic partitioning by time
-- ✅ Built-in compression
-- ✅ Fast time-range queries
-- ✅ Automatic retention
```

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Now → 5K Vessels (2-3 months)
**Stay on Railway, add optimizations**

Actions:
- ✅ Implement data retention (this week)
- ✅ Add position throttling (70% reduction)
- ✅ Monitor storage daily

Cost: $20-50/month

### Phase 2: 5K → 50K Vessels (3-6 months)
**Migrate to TimescaleDB**

Actions:
- 🔄 Set up Timescale Cloud account
- 🔄 Migrate schema and data
- 🔄 Update application code
- 🔄 Test thoroughly

Cost: $370/month

### Phase 3: 50K → 100K Vessels (6-12 months)
**Optimize and scale**

Actions:
- 🔄 Self-host on AWS if needed
- 🔄 Add regional filtering
- 🔄 Implement edge caching

Cost: $600-840/month

## When Must You Migrate?

### 🚨 Critical Thresholds

| Vessels | Storage | Action Required |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **< 3,000** | < 50 GB | Stay on Railway, monitor |
| **3,000-5,000** | 50-80 GB | ⚠️ Prepare TimescaleDB migration |
| **5,000+** | 80+ GB | 🚨 MUST migrate or service fails |

**Your current 1,400 vessels:** You have ~2 months before critical threshold

---

## Immediate Action Items

### This Week (Do Now)
```bash
1. Implement data retention strategy
   - 7 days full resolution
   - 30 days 5-minute samples
   - Automatic cleanup

2. Add position throttling
   - Only save if significant change
   - 70% data reduction

3. Set up monitoring
   - Storage usage alerts
   - Ingestion rate tracking
```

### This Month (Prepare)
```bash
1. Open Timescale Cloud free trial
2. Test migration with sample data
3. Update budget projections
4. Document migration plan
```

### Next Quarter (Execute)
```bash
1. Execute TimescaleDB migration
2. Optimize queries for time-series
3. Add proper monitoring
4. Load test at target scale
```

## Cost Comparison Summary

| Solution | Setup Time | Monthly Cost | Max Vessels | Complexity |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Current Railway** | 0 | $5-20 | 3,000 | Low |
| **Railway Team** | 0 | $300+ | 5,000 | Low |
| **TimescaleDB Cloud** | 2 weeks | $370 | 50,000 | Medium |
| **AWS Self-Hosted** | 4 weeks | $600-840 | 100,000+ | High |

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Can we just upgrade Railway to a higher tier?
**A:** No. Even Team tier ($100/mo) maxes out at ~5,000 vessels due to network/storage limits.

### Q: Do we need to rewrite our application?
**A:** No. TimescaleDB is PostgreSQL. Just change the connection string and add `create_hypertable()`.

### Q: What if we only track vessels in specific regions?
**A:** Great optimization! Can reduce by 80%. But still need TimescaleDB at 10K+ vessels.

### Q: Can we start with TimescaleDB free tier?
**A:** Yes for development. But production needs paid tier ($100-300/mo) for your scale.

### Q: What happens if we don't migrate?
**A:** Service will fail when you hit storage or network limits. Could lose data.

## Recommended Decision

### For Next 3 Months
✅ **Keep Railway + Implement Retention**
- Cost: $20-50/month
- Effort: Low (1 week)
- Risk: Low

### For 6-12 Months
✅ **Migrate to TimescaleDB Cloud**
- Cost: $370/month
- Effort: Medium (2-3 weeks)
- Risk: Low (managed service)

### For 12+ Months
✅ **Self-Host if Exceeding 50K Vessels**
- Cost: $600-840/month
- Effort: High (1-2 months)
- Risk: Medium (need DevOps)

## Bottom Line

**Can you scale to 50K-100K vessels?**  
✅ **Yes**, but requires infrastructure migration

**Total cost at 50K vessels:**  
💰 **$370/month** (TimescaleDB Cloud)

**Total cost at 100K vessels:**  
💰 **$600-840/month** (AWS self-hosted)

**When to migrate:**  
⏰ **Before hitting 5,000 vessels** (~2-3 months)

**Immediate next step:**  
📋 **Implement retention strategy this week** (already documented)

## Need Help Deciding?

Consider:
1. **Growth rate:** How fast will you reach 5K vessels?
2. **Budget:** Can you allocate $370-840/month?
3. **Team capacity:** Do you have time for 2-week migration?
4. **Risk tolerance:** Comfortable with infrastructure changes?

**My recommendation:** 
- ✅ Implement retention NOW (buy time)
- ✅ Start TimescaleDB trial ASAP (validate approach)
- ✅ Plan migration for when you hit 3,000 vessels
- ✅ Budget $370/month for production

**Ready to proceed?** I can help implement the retention strategy right now, and prepare TimescaleDB migration plan for later.
