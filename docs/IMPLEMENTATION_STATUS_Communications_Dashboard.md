## 🔄 Migration Tasks

**Options for Old Pages:**
1. **Add redirects** (Recommended)
   ```typescript
   // /dashboard/vessel-alerts/page.tsx
   redirect('/dashboard/communications#vessel-alerts')
   
   // /dashboard/notifications/page.tsx
   redirect('/dashboard/communications#delivery-logs')
   ```

2. **Keep as legacy** with deprecation notice
3. **Delete entirely** after migration complete

## 💡 Architectural Decisions

### Why Tabs?
- **Pros:** Single mental model, easy navigation, consistent UI
- **Cons:** All code loads upfront (mitigated by lazy loading)
- **Decision:** Tabs with hash routing for direct links

### Why Separate Tab Files?
- **Pros:** Code organization, easier to maintain, lazy loading ready
- **Cons:** More files
- **Decision:** Better long-term maintainability

### Why Hash Routing?
- **Pros:** Shareable links, browser history, no page reload
- **Cons:** Slightly more complex
- **Decision:** Better UX worth the complexity
