# Vessel Data Enhancement - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed  
**Deployment ID**: Check Railway logs

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

1. ✅ **Identified missing vessel data fields**
2. ✅ **Updated schema to support enrichment data**
3. ✅ **Enhanced AIS ingestion services** to capture all available data
4. ✅ **Created batch enrichment infrastructure** for external data sources
5. ✅ **Deployed to production**

## 📊 What Changed

### Schema Updates

#### Vessel Table - New Fields
| Field | Type | Purpose | Source |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| `height` | Float | Bridge clearance calculations | AIS/OpenShipData |
| `buildYear` | Int | Vessel age, insurance | External APIs |
| `manager` | String | Ship management company | External APIs |
| `enrichedAt` | DateTime | Track enrichment freshness | System |
| `enrichmentSource` | String | Data quality tracking | System |

Note: `grossTonnage`, `owner`, `operator` already existed in schema

#### VesselPosition Table - New Fields  
| Field | Type | Purpose | Source |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| `captain` | String | Voyage-specific master | OpenShipData |
| `rateOfTurn` | Float | Collision risk detection | AIS PositionReport |
| `positionAccuracy` | Boolean | GPS quality indicator | AIS PositionReport |

Note: `destination`, `eta`, `draught` already existed but weren't populated

### Code Changes

#### 1. AISStream Service (`lib/services/aisstream-service.ts`)

**Added to PositionReport processing:**
- Rate of turn capture (validates -128 = not available)
- Position accuracy flag
- Height calculation from dimensions

**Added to ShipStaticData processing:**
- Height from vessel dimensions
- Flag derivation from MMSI (already done)

**Example:**
```typescript
await prisma.vesselPosition.create({
  data: {
    // ... existing fields
    rateOfTurn: pos.RateOfTurn !== -128 ? pos.RateOfTurn : undefined,
    positionAccuracy: pos.PositionAccuracy,
  }
})
```

#### 2. OpenShipData Service (`lib/services/openshipdata-service.ts`)

**Added to vessel upsert:**
- Height from `heightMeters`
- Flag derivation from MMSI (already done)

**Added to position creation:**
- Captain from `captain` field
- Destination from `destinationName`
- ETA from `etaSecUtc` timestamp

**Example:**
```typescript
await prisma.vesselPosition.create({
  data: {
    // ... existing fields
    captain: report.captain,
    destination: report.destinationName,
    eta: report.etaSecUtc ? new Date(report.etaSecUtc * 1000) : undefined,
  }
})
```

#### 3. New Enrichment Infrastructure

**Created:**
- `/lib/enrichment/equasis-enricher.ts` - Enricher class for external data
- `/scripts/enrich-vessels-batch.ts` - Batch enrichment script

**Features:**
- Priority-based enrichment (high-value vessels first)
- Data validation
- Rate limiting
- Progress tracking
- Statistics reporting

## 🗄️ Database Migration

**Approach**: Manual SQL migration (required for TimescaleDB hypertable)

**Migration file**: `/migrations/add-enrichment-fields.sql`

**Executed via**: `npx tsx scripts/run-manual-migration.ts`

**Results:**
- ✅ 5 new columns added to `vessels` table
- ✅ 3 new columns added to `vessel_positions` table
- ✅ All 724,258 existing position records preserved
- ✅ 13,796 vessel records unaffected

## 📈 Expected Coverage (7 days post-deployment)

| Field | Source | Target Coverage | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------|
| **rateOfTurn** | AIS PositionReport | 95%+ | Every position has this |
| **positionAccuracy** | AIS PositionReport | 95%+ | Every position has this |
| **captain** | OpenShipData | 15-20% | Limited availability |
| **destination** | AIS/OpenShipData | 60%+ | Vessels underway transmit |
| **eta** | AIS/OpenShipData | 50%+ | Only when voyage set |
| **height** | AIS/OpenShipData | 70%+ | From vessel dimensions |
| **grossTonnage** | External APIs | 0% | Requires manual enrichment |
| **owner** | External APIs | 0% | Requires manual enrichment |
| **operator** | External APIs | 0% | Requires manual enrichment |
| **manager** | External APIs | 0% | Requires manual enrichment |

## 🔄 Natural Backfill Strategy

**Approach**: Let new incoming data populate fields over time

**Why?**
- Zero risk - no database load
- Automatic - as vessels transmit
- Existing 724K positions don't need updating (historical data)
- Only new positions will have enhanced data

**Timeline**:
- **6-24 hours**: Active vessels (transmit frequently)
- **2-7 days**: Occasional vessels
- **Never**: Inactive vessels (acceptable)

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (24 hours)

1. **Monitor deployment logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs -f -s peaceful-abundance
   ```

2. **Verify new data ingestion**
   ```sql
   -- Check recent positions with new fields
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as total,
     COUNT(rate_of_turn) as has_rot,
     COUNT(position_accuracy) as has_accuracy,
     COUNT(captain) as has_captain,
     COUNT(destination) as has_destination
   FROM vessel_positions
   WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```

3. **Sample data validation**
   ```sql
   -- View sample enriched data
   SELECT 
     v.mmsi,
     v.name,
     v.height,
     vp.rate_of_turn,
     vp.position_accuracy,
     vp.captain,
     vp.destination
   FROM vessels v
   JOIN vessel_positions vp ON vp.vessel_id = v.id
   WHERE vp.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Short Term (2-7 days)

1. **Run coverage analysis**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/enrich-vessels-batch.ts --stats
   ```

2. **Monitor field population rates**
   - Check dashboard/logs daily
   - Target: 60%+ coverage for AIS fields by day 3

3. **Identify data quality issues**
   - Invalid rate of turn values
   - Malformed destination strings
   - ETA parsing errors

### Medium Term (1-4 weeks)

1. **Decide on external enrichment**
   - If coverage < 70% for critical fields → Run targeted backfill
   - Evaluate cost vs benefit of paid APIs
   - Consider Equasis CSV import for basic fields

2. **Implement batch enrichment** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Enrich high-priority vessels
   npx tsx scripts/enrich-vessels-batch.ts --limit 100
   
   # View progress
   npx tsx scripts/enrich-vessels-batch.ts --stats
   ```

3. **Set up enrichment automation** (optional)
   - Schedule daily enrichment job
   - Prioritize vessels with recent activity
   - Re-enrich stale data (>90 days old)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: New fields not populating

**Check:**
1. Deployment successful? `railway logs`
2. AISStream connected? Look for "Connected to AISStream.io"
3. Data validation passing? Check for errors in processMessage

**Solution:**
- Review error logs
- Verify AIS messages contain expected fields
- Check type mappings are correct

### Issue: Rate of turn always null

**Possible causes:**
- AIS transmitting -128 (not available)
- Type mismatch in parsing
- Validation rejecting values

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Add logging in aisstream-service.ts
console.log('RateOfTurn raw:', pos.RateOfTurn)
```

### Issue: Captain never populated

**Expected behavior:**
- Captain data is RARE in AIS feeds
- Only OpenShipData provides it occasionally
- 15-20% coverage is normal

## 📊 Monitoring Queries

### Coverage Dashboard
```sql
-- Vessel field coverage
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_vessels,
  COUNT(height) as has_height,
  COUNT(build_year) as has_build_year,
  COUNT(gross_tonnage) as has_gt,
  COUNT(owner) as has_owner,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(height) / COUNT(*), 1) as height_pct,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(gross_tonnage) / COUNT(*), 1) as gt_pct
FROM vessels
WHERE active = true;
```

```sql
-- Position field coverage (last 24 hours)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_positions,
  COUNT(rate_of_turn) as has_rot,
  COUNT(position_accuracy) as has_accuracy,
  COUNT(captain) as has_captain,
  COUNT(destination) as has_dest,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(rate_of_turn) / COUNT(*), 1) as rot_pct,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(destination) / COUNT(*), 1) as dest_pct
FROM vessel_positions
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### Data Quality Check
```sql
-- Invalid rate of turn values
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM vessel_positions 
WHERE rate_of_turn NOT BETWEEN -720 AND 720
  AND rate_of_turn IS NOT NULL;

-- Vessels with unusual height
SELECT mmsi, name, height 
FROM vessels 
WHERE height > 100 OR height < 0;
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics

After 7 days, we expect:

✅ **95%+ positions** with rate_of_turn and position_accuracy  
✅ **60%+ positions** with destination data  
✅ **70%+ vessels** with height data  
✅ **50%+ positions** with ETA when applicable  
✅ **15%+ positions** with captain (where available)  

External enrichment fields (grossTonnage, owner, operator) require separate action.
