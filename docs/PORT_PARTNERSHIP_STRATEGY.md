  async connectPort(port: PortConfig) {
    // Support multiple protocols
    switch (port.protocol) {
      case 'NMEA': return new NMEAConnection(port)
      case 'HTTP': return new HTTPConnection(port)
      case 'WS': return new WebSocketConnection(port)
    }
  }
  
  async processVTSMessage(portId: string, msg: VTSMessage) {
    const vessel = this.parseVTSVessel(msg)
    vessel.dataSource = `vts_${portId}`
    
    await this.upsertVesselPosition(vessel)
    await this.checkProximityAlerts(vessel)
  }
}

// Port Alert Dissemination
class PortAlertService {
  async dispatchAlert(event: EarthquakeEvent) {
    const ports = await this.findAffectedPorts(event)
    
    for (const port of ports) {
      const alert = this.formatPortAlert(port, event)
      
      // Send via port's channel (email, API, VHF)
      await this.sendToPort(port, alert)
      await this.logPortAlert(port, event)
    }
  }
}
```

## Part 5: Benefits Beyond Coverage

### 1. Direct Emergency Channels

**Harbor Master:** Instant voice/SMS, can order evacuations  
**Pilots:** On vessels, face-to-face warnings  
**Ship Agents:** Contact owners/operators, family alerts

**Value:** Alert-to-action time drops from 10-30min → 1-5min

### 2. Regulatory Leverage

**Port Mandates:**
```
"All vessels entering [Port] must register with 
Regional Emergency Alert System 24h prior to arrival"
```

**Enforcement:** Delayed entry, higher fees, coast guard flag  
**Impact:** 80-90% voluntary registration rate

### 3. Authority Endorsement

**Credibility:** Port authority logos, government backing  
**Media:** "Port of LA Partners with Alert Startup"  
**Growth:** Easier expansion, attracts funding

### 4. Network Effects

**Cross-Port Intelligence:**
- Track vessels across multiple ports
- Predict locations even if AIS dark
- Fleet-wide alerts for shipping companies
- Historical analytics for impact assessment

## Part 6: Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Bureaucracy

**Problem:** 6-18 month approval cycles

**Solutions:**
- Start with harbor masters (bypass boards)
- Use existing frameworks (SOLAS, IMO)
- Approach after crises (post-earthquake)

### Challenge 2: Data Privacy

**Problem:** Vessel positions are sensitive

**Solutions:**
- Anonymization (hash MMSIs, round coordinates)
- Air-gapped systems (one-way data flow)
- Get certified (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR)

**Cost:** $15-30K for certifications

### Challenge 3: Technical Integration

**Problem:** Every port has different systems

**Solutions:**
- "Port-in-a-Box" hardware ($500/port + $2K setup)
- Graduated integration (email → CSV → API → VTS)
- Partner with VTS vendors (deploy to 100+ ports at once)

### Challenge 4: Language Barriers

**Problem:** 50+ countries, multiple languages

**Solutions:**
- Regional coordinators ($50-80K/year per region)
- Professional translations ($10-15K for 10 languages)
- In-person visits ($5-10K/year per region)

### Challenge 5: Sustainability

**Problem:** Feeds break, staff turnover

**Solutions:**
- Automated health monitoring
- Redundant data sources
- Annual relationship reviews
- 2-year MOU renewals with auto-renewal

## Part 8: Path to 100% Coverage

### Realistic Limits

**What Port Partnerships CAN'T Cover:**
- Open ocean (>50nm from coast) - needs satellite AIS
- Vessels without AIS/radar signature - impossible to track
- Deliberately dark vessels - won't cooperate
- Very small craft (<5m) - below radar detection

**Maximum Achievable: 95-97%** (not 100%)

### To Reach 95%+

**Port Partnerships (89%) +**

**1. Satellite AIS** (+5-7%)
- Covers open ocean gaps
- Cost: $1,000-3,000/month
- Providers: exactEarth, Spire, ORBCOMM

**2. Fishing Cooperative Partnerships** (+2-3%)
- Register fishing fleets directly
- Partner with fishermen's associations
- GPS tracking for non-AIS boats

**3. Vessel Owner Self-Registration** (+1-2%)
- Opt-in portal for vessel operators
- Incentivize with free weather/safety data
- Covers vessels below AIS mandate

**Combined: 92-96% coverage**

---

- Target 3 pilot ports (LA, Valparaiso, Piraeus)
- Sign MOUs, build technical integration
- Demonstrate value to port authorities
- **Budget:** $25-40K
- **Coverage gain:** +5-8%

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Scale Pacific**

### Success Factors

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Personal relationships** with harbor masters
2. **Public safety mission** (not commercial)
3. **Technical simplicity** (make it easy for ports)
4. **Quick wins** (prove value in pilot phase)
5. **Regulatory leverage** (frame as SOLAS compliance)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with English-speaking ports (US, Greece)
- Hire regional coordinators early (cultural bridge)
- Build automated systems (reduce maintenance)
- Get security certifications upfront (unlock government partnerships)
- Create "Port-in-a-Box" hardware solution (solves integration)

### Timeline to 90% Coverage

```
Month 0-6:   3 ports,  70% coverage → $25-40K
Month 7-12:  10 ports, 80% coverage → +$25-35K
Month 13-18: 30 ports, 89% coverage → +$25-35K
Year 2:      30 ports + satellite, 95% coverage → +$165-260K/yr

Total 18-month investment: $75-110K
Achieves 89% coverage (90% with satellite AIS)
```

## Conclusion

**Port partnerships are THE path to 90%+ vessel coverage** in high-risk seismic zones.

**Why it works:**
✅ Ports have VTS systems tracking 100% of vessels in approaches  
✅ Regulatory authority to mandate registration  
✅ Direct communication channels to vessels  
✅ Public safety mission alignment  
✅ Free data in exchange for emergency service  

**Realistic outcome:** 
- 18 months, $75-110K investment
- 89% coverage (95% with satellite AIS add-on)
- Direct emergency channels to harbor masters/pilots
- Authority endorsement and regulatory leverage
- Network effects across 30 major ports

**This is achievable, scalable, and sustainable.**

Start with 3 pilot ports (LA, Valparaiso, Piraeus) in next 6 months. Prove the model. Then scale.
