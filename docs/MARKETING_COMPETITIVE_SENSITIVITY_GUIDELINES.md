## ❌ DO NOT MENTION (Competitive Sensitive)

### Specific AI Models
- ❌ "GPT-4"
- ❌ "GPT-4o-mini"
- ❌ "GPT-4 Turbo"
- ❌ Any OpenAI product names
- ❌ Specific model versions

**Why:** Competitors can replicate if they know exact models. Keep it generic: "advanced AI" or "state-of-the-art language models"

### Data Source Specifics (Beyond Attribution Pages)
- ❌ Exact count: "7 data sources"
- ❌ Specific names: "PTWC, JMA, USGS, DART, GeoNet, EMSC, FDSN"
- ❌ Specific buoy IDs: "46404, 46407, etc."
- ❌ Number of buoys: "13 DART buoys"
- ❌ API endpoints or access methods

**Why:** This is our strategic advantage. Competitors could approach same sources.  
**Exception:** Legal attribution pages (required by NOAA, JMA, etc.)

### Technical Implementation Details
- ❌ Database systems: "TimescaleDB", "PostgreSQL", etc.
- ❌ Specific algorithms or formulas
- ❌ Exact scoring ranges: "0-100 scale"
- ❌ Internal system architecture
- ❌ Specific third-party integrations

**Why:** Implementation details are our competitive moat. Keep it outcome-focused.

### Third-Party Service Providers
- ❌ SMS provider names (Twilio, etc.)
- ❌ Email service providers
- ❌ Satellite provider contracts: "Iridium", "Inmarsat"
- ❌ Cloud infrastructure providers
- ❌ Analytics platforms

**Why:** Pricing power, negotiation leverage, vendor relationships.  
**Exception:** General "satellite communications" is OK, specific brands are not.

### Exact Timing Metrics (Internal)
- ❌ "Sub-60s maritime scoring" (too specific)
- ❌ "T+15s detection, T+30s identification" (reveals architecture)
- ❌ "30-60 second AIS updates"

**Why:** Reveals system performance characteristics competitors can benchmark.  
**Use instead:** "Rapid", "Fast", "Near real-time"

### Pricing Details (Except Public Pricing Page)
- ❌ Cost per alert
- ❌ Volume pricing tiers
- ❌ Competitor pricing comparisons
- ❌ Margin information

### Patent/IP Details
- ❌ "Patent-pending" (can be searched)
- ✅ "Proprietary technology" (generic)
- ❌ Specific algorithm descriptions
- ❌ Innovation timelines that reveal development process

## 📋 REPLACEMENT GUIDELINES

### When Writing Marketing Copy

| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Say Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "GPT-4 powered" | "AI-powered" / "Advanced AI" |
| "7 data sources" | "Multiple authoritative sources" |
| "PTWC, JMA, USGS..." | "Global seismic networks" |
| "13 DART buoys" | "Advanced ocean sensors" |
| "TimescaleDB" | "Optimized data storage" |
| "Twilio SMS" | "Multi-channel delivery" |
| "Iridium satellite" | "Satellite communications" |
| "0-100 impact score" | "AI-powered impact scoring" |
| "Sub-60s scoring" | "Rapid threat assessment" |
| "AIS integration" | "Vessel tracking" |
| "Patent-pending algorithm" | "Proprietary technology" |

### For Data Sources (Legal/Attribution Context Only)

**On `/data-sources` or `/about` Attribution Section:**
- ✅ Can list specific sources with proper attribution
- ✅ Must include required disclaimers
- ✅ Can show logos with permission
- ✅ Format: "Data provided by [SOURCE]. Not endorsed by [SOURCE]."

**Example Attribution Block:**
```
Data Sources

We rely on the following authoritative sources:

• NOAA/National Weather Service - Tsunami alerts and DART buoy data
  (Required attribution: Data provided as-is. Not endorsed by NOAA.)

• US Geological Survey - Earthquake data
  (Required attribution: Data provided as-is. Not endorsed by USGS.)

[Continue for other sources...]

For complete details, see our Data Sources page.
```

**On Marketing Pages (Homepage, Features, etc.):**
- ❌ Do NOT list specific source names
- ✅ Use: "multiple authoritative global networks"
- ✅ Use: "regional and international monitoring authorities"
- ✅ Link to attribution page for details

## 🎯 MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### Focus On:
1. **Outcomes** - What the customer achieves
2. **Benefits** - Why it matters to them
3. **Differentiation** - What makes us unique (without revealing how)
4. **Results** - Metrics that show value

### Avoid:
1. **Implementation** - How we built it
2. **Vendors** - Who we buy from
3. **Architecture** - System design details
4. **Secret sauce** - Proprietary algorithms

### Example Transformation

**❌ Too Specific:**
```
"Our GPT-4o-mini powered system integrates data from PTWC, JMA, 
USGS, and 13 DART buoys via TimescaleDB, delivering alerts via 
Twilio SMS in sub-60 seconds with 0-100 impact scores calculated 
using our patent-pending algorithm."
```

**✅ Outcome-Focused:**
```
"Our AI-powered platform combines multiple authoritative global 
sources and advanced ocean sensors to deliver alerts in under 
30 seconds with intelligent impact scoring that tells you exactly 
which vessels need immediate action."
```

**What Changed:**
- GPT-4o-mini → AI-powered
- Specific sources → multiple authoritative global sources
- 13 DART buoys → advanced ocean sensors
- TimescaleDB → (removed, not relevant to customer)
- Twilio SMS → alerts (channel details not needed)
- Sub-60 seconds → under 30 seconds (customer-facing SLA)
- 0-100 scores → intelligent impact scoring
- Patent-pending algorithm → (removed, implied in "intelligent")

## ✏️ CONTENT REVIEW CHECKLIST

Before publishing ANY marketing content, check:

- [ ] No specific AI model names (GPT-X, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] No exact data source count (7, 13, etc.)
- [ ] No specific data source names (except attribution pages)
- [ ] No third-party vendor names (Twilio, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] No database/infrastructure specifics (TimescaleDB, etc.)
- [ ] No exact internal timing metrics (T+15s, sub-60s, etc.)
- [ ] No proprietary algorithm descriptions
- [ ] No specific satellite provider names
- [ ] No "patent-pending" language
- [ ] Focus on outcomes, not implementation
- [ ] Benefits clear to non-technical readers
- [ ] Competitive differentiation without revealing secrets

## 🔍 COMPETITOR INTELLIGENCE RISK

### What Competitors Can Learn From Bad Messaging:

If we say: **"7 data sources including PTWC, JMA, USGS, DART..."**

Competitor learns:
1. Which sources to approach for partnerships
2. Our coverage strategy (multiple redundant sources)
3. How many sources they need to match us
4. Specific authorities to replicate our coverage

If we say: **"GPT-4o-mini for scenario generation"**

Competitor learns:
1. Exact model to use for similar features
2. Our AI strategy and vendor choices
3. Cost structure (they can estimate our OpenAI spend)
4. Technical implementation approach

### Better Approach:

Say: **"Advanced AI scenario generation with high accuracy"**

Competitor learns:
1. We have AI capabilities (obvious from feature)
2. Nothing about implementation
3. Nothing about vendors or models
4. Nothing they can directly replicate

---

## 📞 WHEN IN DOUBT

**Ask yourself:**
1. "Would I want competitors to know this?"
2. "Does the customer care about this specific detail?"
3. "Can I express the benefit without the technical detail?"

**General Rule:**
- If it's a vendor choice → Don't mention
- If it's an implementation detail → Don't mention
- If it's a customer outcome → Mention
- If it's a competitive differentiator → Mention the "what", not the "how"

## 🎓 TRAINING EXAMPLES

### Good: Outcome-Focused
```
"Our maritime intelligence platform tracks vessels worldwide and 
calculates risk scores in real-time, so you know which ships need 
immediate alerts during tsunami events."
```
**Why good:** Benefits clear, no implementation details

### Bad: Implementation-Focused
```
"We use AIS data aggregation via MarineTraffic API with our 
proprietary 0-100 scoring algorithm running on TimescaleDB to 
calculate vessel-specific threat levels."
```
**Why bad:** Reveals vendors (MarineTraffic), architecture (TimescaleDB), exact scoring range (0-100)

### Fixed Version:
```
"We aggregate vessel position data and apply intelligent scoring 
to calculate vessel-specific threat levels in seconds."
```
**Why better:** Same benefit, zero competitive intelligence value
