## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting Guide

### Database Issues
```bash
# Reset database (dev only)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Check connection
npx prisma db pull

# Verify data
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vessels"
```

### Background Job Issues
```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs geo-fence-monitor

# Restart specific job
pm2 restart geo-fence-monitor

# Monitor in real-time
pm2 monit
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...

# Monitor memory
pm2 monit

# Check cache freshness
SELECT updated_at FROM vessel_activity_realtime
```

## ðŸ“ž Support & Questions

Before starting implementation:
1. Review `MASTER_ROADMAP.md` for the big picture
2. Read the data sources guide for insurance features
3. Check each week's detailed implementation file
4. Verify all prerequisites are in place

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Uses OpenStreetMap (not Mapbox) - free, open-source
- Cache table pattern (not materialized views) - real-time updates
- BullMQ for notification queuing
- PM2 for background job management
- Railway PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. âœ… **Review MASTER_ROADMAP.md** - Understand overall timeline
2. âœ… **Start with WEEK1_FLEET.md** - Begin Day 1 implementation
3. âœ… **Follow sequential order** - Each week builds on previous
4. âœ… **Test as you go** - Don't skip testing sections
5. âœ… **Deploy incrementally** - Push to production after each week

**You're ready to build! Start with Week 1 Day 1.** ðŸš€
