# Vessel Tracking - Complete Summary

## What You Identified

**Question:** "Don't we need to ingest the data? We are talking a lot of ships here?!"

**Answer:** **YES!** Absolutely correct. You need a persistent background worker.

---

## The Solution

### ✅ Created Files

1. **`lib/workers/vessel-ingestion-worker.ts`**
   - Background worker class
   - Runs 24/7 ingesting vessel data
   - Auto-reconnects on failures
   - Reports stats every 5 minutes

2. **`scripts/start-vessel-worker.ts`**
   - Standalone script to run the worker
   - Validates environment variables
   - Can run independently from Next.js

3. **`pnpm worker:vessels`**
   - Package.json script to start worker
   - Simple command to run

4. **`README_VESSEL_WORKER.md`**
   - Complete documentation
   - Production deployment guides
   - Monitoring and troubleshooting

---

## How to Use

### Development (2 Terminals)

**Terminal 1 - Worker:**
```bash
pnpm worker:vessels
```

**Terminal 2 - Web App:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Browser:**
```
http://localhost:3000/test-vessels
```

### Production (Railway)

**Option 1: Separate Services (Recommended)**
- Service 1: Web app (`pnpm start`)
- Service 2: Worker (`pnpm worker:vessels`)
- Both use same `DATABASE_URL`

**Option 2: Single Service with Procfile**
```
web: pnpm start
worker: pnpm worker:vessels
```

## Data Flow

```
AISStream.io (WebSocket)
       ↓
   Every 2-10 seconds: vessel position
       ↓
Vessel Worker (always running)
       ↓
Upsert to PostgreSQL
       ↓
Your Next.js app reads from DB
       ↓
Display on map with Leaflet
```

## Expected Performance

| Time | Vessels Tracked | DB Positions | Updates/Hour |
|------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 hour | 1,000-2,000 | 5,000-10,000 | ~5,000 |
| 1 day | 5,000-10,000 | 50,000-100,000 | ~50,000 |
| 1 week | 10,000-15,000 | 300,000-500,000 | ~300,000 |

## Why a Separate Worker?

### Next.js Limitations

Next.js is designed for:
- ✅ Web requests
- ✅ API routes
- ✅ Server-side rendering

NOT designed for:
- ❌ Long-running background tasks
- ❌ Persistent WebSocket connections
- ❌ 24/7 data ingestion

### The Worker Solution

- ✅ Runs independently (separate process)
- ✅ Survives Next.js restarts
- ✅ Can be scaled separately
- ✅ Dedicated to ingestion only
- ✅ Doesn't block web requests

## Next Steps

### 1. Start the Worker NOW

```bash
# Open a terminal
pnpm worker:vessels

# Should see:
# 🚀 Starting vessel ingestion worker...
# ✅ Connected to AISStream.io WebSocket
# 🚢 AISStream: Received position for vessel 367719770
```

### 2. In Another Terminal, Start Web App

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 3. View Ships

```bash
open http://localhost:3000/test-vessels
```

Wait 1-2 minutes, click "Refresh"

### 4. Deploy to Railway

**Create Second Service:**
1. Railway Dashboard → New Service
2. Link same repo
3. Custom start command: `pnpm worker:vessels`
4. Add env vars: `AISSTREAM_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`
5. Deploy

**Now you have:**
- Main app ingesting vessels 24/7
- Web interface showing live data
- Both sharing same database

---

## Monitoring

### Check Worker Status

**Terminal:**
```bash
# Stats logged every 5 minutes
📊 === Vessel Ingestion Statistics ===
⏱️  Uptime: 0h 5m
🚢 Vessels in DB: 127
📍 Positions in DB: 892
```

**Database:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Vessel";
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "VesselPosition" WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes';
```

### Railway Logs

- Worker service → Deployments → Logs
- See real-time ingestion

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I run worker and web in same process?**
A: Not recommended. Keeps them separate for stability.

**Q: What if worker crashes?**
A: Auto-reconnects on errors. Use PM2 or Railway auto-restart.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Free! AISStream free, OpenShipData free, Railway free tier covers both services.

**Q: How do I stop ingestion?**
A: Ctrl+C in worker terminal, or stop Railway service.

**Q: Database growing too large?**
A: Archive positions older than 7 days (see README_VESSEL_WORKER.md).
