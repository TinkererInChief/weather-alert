            ## 🤖 Automated DART Station Update
            
            This PR contains updates to the DART station list fetched from NOAA's official API.
            
            **Source:** https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/activestations.xml
            **Updated:** ${{ github.run_id }}
            **Workflow:** Weekly automatic check
            
            ### Changes
            
            The DART station list has been updated with the latest active stations from NOAA.
            This may include:
            - 🆕 New station deployments
            - ❌ Decommissioned stations removed
            - 📝 Updated station metadata
            
            ### Review Checklist
            
            - [ ] Verify station count is reasonable (40-60 stations)
            - [ ] Check that no critical stations were removed
            - [ ] Review the diff for unexpected changes
            
            ### Testing
            
            This update is safe to merge as it only affects the DART station database.
            The change will take effect on next deployment.
