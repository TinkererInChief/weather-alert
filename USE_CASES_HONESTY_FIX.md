# Use Cases Section - Honesty Fix

## Problem Identified
The "Protecting Teams Across Industries" section looked dishonest with:
- ❌ Fake company names (OceanFleet, ManufacturingCo, GlobalServices)
- ❌ Fabricated metrics (90 seconds, 12/12 vessels, 89 employees)
- ❌ Testimonial-style language presenting fictional results as real
- ❌ Implied customer base that doesn't exist

**This undermined credibility and could be seen as deceptive marketing.**

---

## Solution: Honest Capability Showcase

Reframed the section to be truthful while still showcasing possibilities for different industries.

### New Approach:
1. ✅ **Maritime as primary focus** - Honest about what's built and ready
2. ✅ **Other industries as potential** - Clear about what's possible with custom development
3. ✅ **Capabilities vs. testimonials** - Show what the platform CAN do, not fake results
4. ✅ **Transparent language** - "could be adapted", "potential application", "not yet implemented"

---

The underlying technology could be adapted for other coastal industries 
with custom development."
```
