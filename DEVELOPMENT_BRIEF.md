# Development Brief for Next IDE AI Agent

## Quick Context
You're taking over a Next.js Emergency Alert Command Center with two major features in development:
1. **SMS OTP Authentication** (70% complete) - replacing email magic links
2. **Multi-Channel Notifications** (40% complete) - unified SMS/WhatsApp/Voice/Email alerts

## Immediate Action Items

### 🎯 Priority 1: Complete SMS OTP Authentication
The authentication system is nearly production-ready but needs final integration:

**What's Done:**
- All components built and tested (`PhoneNumberForm.tsx`, `OTPVerificationForm.tsx`)
- API endpoints working (`/api/auth/otp/request`, `/api/auth/otp/verify`)
- NextAuth integration complete (`lib/auth.ts`)

**What's Needed:**
- Update `app/login/page.tsx` to use the two-step OTP flow instead of email
- Add comprehensive error handling throughout the flow
- Write unit tests for API routes and integration tests

**Files to Focus On:**
- `app/login/page.tsx` - Main integration point
- `.kiro/specs/sms-otp-authentication/tasks.md` - Detailed task list
- `components/auth/` - Ready-to-use components

### 🎯 Priority 2: Multi-Channel Notification Database Schema
The notification system needs database tables for tracking:

**What's Designed:**
- Complete schema in `.kiro/specs/multi-channel-notifications/design.md`
- `notification_jobs` and `channel_results` tables specified

**What's Needed:**
- Create Prisma schema migrations
- Implement job tracking in `NotificationService`
- Add result aggregation and reporting

### 🎯 Priority 3: Testing Infrastructure
Critical functionality lacks test coverage:

**Missing Tests:**
- OTP API route unit tests
- Complete authentication flow integration tests
- Multi-channel notification tests
- Error scenario testing

## Key Files & Their Status

### ✅ Ready to Use
- `lib/auth.ts` - Complete NextAuth OTP provider
- `components/auth/PhoneNumberForm.tsx` - Phone input with validation
- `components/auth/OTPVerificationForm.tsx` - 6-digit OTP input
- `lib/services/notification-service.ts` - Multi-channel orchestrator
- `app/api/auth/otp/` - Working OTP endpoints

### 🔄 Needs Integration
- `app/login/page.tsx` - Update to use OTP components
- Database schema - Add notification tracking tables
- Error handling - Enhance throughout application

### ❌ Missing
- Unit tests for OTP functionality
- Integration tests for auth flow
- Production error handling
- Rate limiting on OTP requests

## Development Patterns

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Current pattern in components
const handleOTPSuccess = (phone: string) => {
  // Phone validated, OTP sent
  setStep('verify')
}

const handleVerifySuccess = () => {
  // OTP verified, session created
  router.push('/dashboard')
}
```

### Notification Pattern
```typescript
// Multi-channel usage
const notificationService = new NotificationService()
const channels = notificationService.getPreferredChannels(contact, severity)
const results = await Promise.all(
  channels.map(channel => 
    notificationService.sendNotification({ contact, channel, templateData })
  )
)
```

## Environment Setup
All required environment variables are documented in `PROJECT_HANDOFF_REPORT.md`. The application uses:
- Twilio for SMS/WhatsApp/Voice
- SendGrid for Email  
- NextAuth for sessions
- Prisma for database

## Testing Strategy
Focus on these test types in order:
1. **Unit tests** - OTP API routes and service functions
2. **Integration tests** - Complete authentication flow
3. **E2E tests** - User journey from login to dashboard

## Quick Wins
1. **Update login page** - Components are ready, just need integration
2. **Add error boundaries** - Improve user experience with better error handling
3. **Create database migrations** - Schema is designed, just needs implementation

## Code Quality Notes
- TypeScript throughout with proper typing
- React components follow hooks patterns
- Services use proper error handling
- Database operations use Prisma for type safety
- NextAuth integration maintains session compatibility

## Debugging Tips
- Check `.kiro/specs/` for complete requirements and design docs
- OTP service logs are comprehensive for troubleshooting
- All services include detailed error messages
- Use the test endpoints in `app/api/test/` for validation

## Success Criteria
**SMS OTP Authentication:**
- Users can log in with phone number + OTP
- Error handling provides clear feedback
- Tests cover critical paths
- Production-ready security measures

**Multi-Channel Notifications:**
- Database tracks all notification attempts
- Reporting shows success/failure rates
- Performance handles bulk notifications
- Error recovery for failed channels
