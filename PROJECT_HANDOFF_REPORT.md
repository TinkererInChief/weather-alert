- ‚úÖ Channel selection logic based on severity levels
- ‚úÖ Message formatting for each channel type
- ‚úÖ Bulk notification capabilities

**In Progress:**
- üîÑ Database schema for notification jobs and results (designed but not implemented)
- üîÑ Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- üîÑ Comprehensive reporting and analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
User ‚Üí Phone Input ‚Üí OTP Request ‚Üí SMS Delivery ‚Üí OTP Verification ‚Üí NextAuth Session ‚Üí Dashboard
```

### Notification Flow
```
Alert Trigger ‚Üí Channel Selection ‚Üí Multi-Channel Dispatch ‚Üí Result Aggregation ‚Üí Reporting
```

### Key Dependencies
- **NextAuth.js** - Session management and authentication
- **Prisma** - Database ORM
- **Twilio** - SMS, WhatsApp, and Voice services
- **SendGrid** - Email service
- **libphonenumber-js** - Phone number validation and formatting

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=

# OTP Configuration
OTP_SECRET=
OTP_LENGTH=6
OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES=10
OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3

# Twilio (SMS, WhatsApp, Voice)

```

## Database Schema

### Existing Tables
- `User` - User accounts with phone numbers
- `SmsOtp` - OTP storage and validation
- `Contact` - Emergency contacts with multiple channels
- `Session` - NextAuth session management

### Planned Extensions (Multi-Channel)
- `notification_jobs` - Track notification tasks
- `channel_results` - Store delivery results per channel

## Testing Status

### Completed Tests
- ‚úÖ PhoneNumberForm component tests
- ‚úÖ OTPVerificationForm component tests

### Missing Tests
- ‚ùå OTP API route unit tests
- ‚ùå NotificationService integration tests
- ‚ùå End-to-end authentication flow tests
- ‚ùå Multi-channel notification tests

## Known Issues & Considerations

### SMS OTP Authentication
1. **Login Page Integration** - Components are ready but not integrated into main login flow
2. **Error Handling** - Basic error handling exists but needs enhancement for production
3. **Rate Limiting** - No rate limiting on OTP requests (security concern)

### Multi-Channel Notifications
1. **Database Schema** - Notification tracking tables designed but not created
2. **Retry Logic** - Basic retry exists but needs exponential backoff
3. **Performance** - No connection pooling or batch optimization
4. **Monitoring** - No metrics or alerting for notification failures

### General
1. **Environment Setup** - Missing comprehensive environment documentation
2. **Deployment** - No deployment configuration or CI/CD pipeline
3. **Security** - Need security audit for OTP implementation

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Complete SMS OTP Integration** - Update login page to use new OTP flow
2. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling** - Improve user experience and debugging
3. **Implement Database Schema** - Create notification tracking tables
4. **Write Critical Tests** - Focus on authentication flow and API endpoints

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization** - Add connection pooling and batch processing
2. **Enhanced Monitoring** - Add metrics and alerting
3. **Security Hardening** - Rate limiting, input validation, security audit

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation** - API documentation and deployment guides
2. **UI/UX Improvements** - Polish authentication and notification interfaces
3. **Advanced Features** - Notification scheduling, template management

## Development Notes

### Code Quality
- Components follow React best practices with TypeScript
- Services use proper error handling and logging
- Database operations use Prisma for type safety
- Authentication integrates cleanly with NextAuth

### Performance Considerations
- Phone number formatting happens client-side
- OTP validation includes attempt limiting
- Bulk notifications include rate limiting delays
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

### Security Measures
- OTPs are hashed before storage
- Phone numbers are validated and normalized
- Sessions use NextAuth security features
- API endpoints include proper error handling

## Handoff Recommendations

1. **Start with SMS OTP completion** - The authentication system is nearly ready for production
2. **Focus on testing** - Critical functionality needs comprehensive test coverage
3. **Review security** - Conduct security audit before production deployment
4. **Monitor performance** - Add logging and metrics for production readiness
5. **Document thoroughly** - Create deployment and maintenance documentation

## Contact Information

All specifications, designs, and implementation details are documented in the `.kiro/specs/` directory. The codebase follows established patterns and should be self-documenting for an experienced developer.
