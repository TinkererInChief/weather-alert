# Use Cases - Competitive Information Removal

## Objective
Remove competitively sensitive technical details while making content more concise.

---

## Removed Competitive Information

### ❌ Data Sources (Except Where Legally Required)
**Removed:**
- "USGS, EMSC, IRIS, JMA, GeoNet" 
- "5 global sources"
- "aggregate data from multiple sources"

**Why:** Revealing specific data sources gives competitors insight into our integrations.

### ❌ Tech Stack Details
**Removed:**
- "Twilio/SendGrid"
- "via Twilio/SendGrid"

**Why:** Revealing infrastructure providers makes it easier for competitors to replicate.

### ❌ Proprietary Models/Algorithms
**Removed:**
- "Okada model"
- "Haversine distance"
- "shallow water equations"

**Why:** While some are known physics, listing specific implementations reveals our technical approach.

## Content Made More Concise

### 🚢 Maritime Operations

**Before (106 words):**
> "The platform is built specifically for maritime alerts in coastal and earthquake-prone areas. Simulate tsunami scenarios using the Okada model, aggregate real-time earthquake data from 5 global sources (USGS, EMSC, IRIS, JMA, GeoNet), calculate wave height and ETA for each vessel using Haversine distance, trigger severity-based escalation policies, and send multi-channel notifications (SMS, Email, WhatsApp) to vessel crews and shore operations."

**After (42 words):**
> "Monitor earthquake and tsunami threats for vessels in coastal and earthquake-prone areas. Physics-based simulation calculates wave height and arrival time for each vessel, with severity-based escalation and multi-channel notifications to crews and shore operations."

**Reduction:** 60% shorter

---

### 🔥 Oil & Gas Operations

**Before (68 words):**
> "The system can very easily be adapted for oil and gas operations including offshore rigs, platforms, and OSVs (Offshore Support Vessels). Monitor earthquake activity and tsunami threats for offshore assets, coordinate evacuation procedures, alert rig crews and support vessels, and manage emergency response across distributed offshore operations in real-time."

**After (36 words):**
> "Easily adapted for offshore rigs, platforms, and OSVs. Monitor seismic and tsunami threats to offshore assets, coordinate evacuation procedures, and manage emergency response across distributed operations."

**Reduction:** 47% shorter

---

### 🏭 Manufacturing & Industrial

**Before (61 words):**
> "For manufacturing facilities in coastal regions or earthquake-prone areas, the underlying alert infrastructure can be adapted to coordinate shift workers, emergency response teams, and equipment shutdown procedures. Monitor both earthquake and tsunami threats, trigger location-based alerts, and manage facility-wide emergency protocols during seismic events."

**After (28 words):**
> "Adaptable for coastal or earthquake-prone manufacturing facilities. Coordinate workforce alerts, emergency response teams, and equipment protocols during seismic events."

**Reduction:** 54% shorter

- Threat Monitoring: Real-time earthquake & tsunami detection
- Emergency Response: Coordinated multi-asset alerts & procedures

**Changes:**
- ✅ More concise labels
- ✅ Generalized "support vessels" instead of listing types

---

### Manufacturing - Before:
- Target Facilities: Coastal/earthquake-prone manufacturing plants
- Alert Distribution: Multi-shift workforce coordination
- Integration Needed: Custom escalation policy configuration

### Manufacturing - After:
- Target Facilities: Coastal/earthquake-prone plants
- Workforce Coordination: Multi-shift emergency alerts
- Custom Integration: Facility-specific escalation policies

**Changes:**
- ✅ Shorter, punchier labels
- ✅ More concise values

## Section Headers & CTAs

### Subtitle - Before:
> "Our platform is purpose-built for earthquake and tsunami alerts in maritime operations. The underlying technology can be adapted for oil & gas and coastal industries with custom development."

### Subtitle - After:
> "Purpose-built for earthquake and tsunami alerts in maritime operations. Adaptable for oil & gas and coastal industries with custom development."

**Reduction:** 19% shorter

---

### CTA - Before:
> "Our platform is production-ready for maritime earthquake and tsunami alerts. Interested in adapting it for your offshore rigs, OSVs, or coastal manufacturing facility? Let's discuss custom development options."

### CTA - After:
> "Production-ready for maritime earthquake and tsunami alerts. Interested in adapting it for offshore operations or coastal facilities? Let's discuss your needs."

**Reduction:** 30% shorter

## What's Protected

### ✅ Technical Implementation Details:
- Specific data sources (USGS, EMSC, IRIS, JMA, GeoNet)
- Infrastructure providers (Twilio, SendGrid)
- Physics models (Okada, Haversine)
- Algorithms and formulas

### ✅ Still Communicates Value:
- Physics-based simulation (general)
- Multi-source data (without specifics)
- Multi-channel alerts (without naming providers)
- Automated calculations (without revealing methods)

---

## Benefits
