From your `pnpm worker:vessels` run, here are all the errors that appeared:

---

## ‚úÖ Error 1: MMSI Type Mismatch (FIXED)

**Error Message:**
```
Invalid `prisma.vessel.upsert()` invocation
Argument `mmsi`: Invalid value provided. Expected String, provided Int.
```

**Appeared for vessels:**
- 224060150 (N ALONSO CAZORLA)
- 311000473 (OSPREY)
- And many others...

**Root Cause:**
- AISStream API sends MMSI as a **number** (e.g., `224060150`)
- Prisma schema defines MMSI as **String**
- We were passing number directly without conversion

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before:
const mmsi = message.MetaData.MMSI

// After:
const mmsi = message.MetaData.MMSI?.toString()
```

**Commit:** `e7aef16` - "fix: Convert MMSI from number to string in AISStream service"

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## ‚úÖ Error 2: Database Connection During Shutdown (FIXED)

**Error Message:**
```
prisma:error Connection has not been opened
Error processing AIS message: Error: Connection has not been opened
```

**When:** After pressing Ctrl+C to stop the worker

**Root Cause:**
1. User sends SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to stop worker
2. Worker gracefully shuts down and closes Prisma connection
3. **BUT:** AISStream WebSocket is still receiving messages
4. Those messages try to write to database after Prisma disconnected
5. Result: "Connection has not been opened" errors

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added shutdown flag
private isShuttingDown = false

// In message handler:
this.ws.on('message', async (data: WebSocket.Data) => {
  // Skip processing if shutting down
  if (this.isShuttingDown) return
  
  try {
    const message: AISStreamMessage = JSON.parse(data.toString())
    await this.processMessage(message)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing AIS message:', error)
  }
})

// In disconnect():
disconnect() {
  this.isShuttingDown = true  // Set flag FIRST
  
  if (this.ws) {
    this.ws.close()
    this.ws = null
    console.log('Disconnected from AISStream.io')
  }
}
```

**Commit:** `10dfe56` - "fix: Prevent database errors during graceful shutdown"

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## Test Again

Run the worker:
```bash
pnpm worker:vessels
```

**You should now see:**
- ‚úÖ No type errors
- ‚úÖ Vessels being created successfully
- ‚úÖ Position updates logging: `üìç Updated position for VESSEL NAME (367719770)`
- ‚úÖ Clean shutdown when pressing Ctrl+C

**After 1-2 minutes:**
- Check database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Vessel";`
- Should see vessels accumulating

**View on map:**
```bash
# In another terminal:
pnpm dev

# Then visit:
http://localhost:3000/test-vessels
```
